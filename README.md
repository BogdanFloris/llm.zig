# `llm.zig`

This project aims to reimplement Andrej Karpathy's `llm.c`—a minimal LLM training codebase—in **Zig**, leveraging **Apple’s Accelerate** framework for hardware-optimized linear algebra on macOS (CPU/GPU/NPU). The goal is to retain `llm.c`'s minimalism and educational clarity while improving performance and portability on Apple silicon.
